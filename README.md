# Sudoku Solver

Sudoku is a simple number game that involves a grid of nine by nine boxes. Numbers from one to nine fill the boxes. No number can occur twice in each row and each column. Bigger boxes are formed three by three smaller boxes. The same rule applies that no number can be repeated within the larger boxes. This is a simple python project to solve sudoku.
